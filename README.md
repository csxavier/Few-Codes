>### Sum by color and count by color across the entire workbook
>> You use this [macro](https://github.com/csxavier/Few-Codes/blob/master/Excel_Functions/Count_or_Sum_cells_by_color_in_Entire_Workbook.txt) in the same manner as the previous code and output the count and sum of the colored cells with the help of the following formulas, `=WbkCountCellsByColor()` and `=WbkSumCellsByColor()`, respectively. 
>> Simply enter either formula in any empty cell on any sheet without defining a range, specify the address of any cell of the needed color in brackets, e.g. `=WbkSumCellsByColor(A1)`, and the formula will display the sum of all the cells shaded with the same color in your workbook.
